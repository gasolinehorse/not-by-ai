            <p>With over <strong><?php include 'all-stats.php'; ?></strong> pages featuring the Not By AI badges, Not By AI is the world's most popular way (likely) to show that your content is not generated by AI. As a forward-thinking organization founded in 2023 in Philadelphia, United States, we focus on promoting content originality. AI is rapidly emerging as the dominant means for humans to create content and, if not already, is projected to become the most popular method in the near future. While it can bring positive impact in certain areas, human-created content will become rare and difficult to identify. </p>
            <p>Through our Not By AI badges, we want to encourage humans to continue to create content for a vital cause: to advance humanity. In 2016, Microsoft introduced Tay, an AI chatbot on Twitter. In less than 24 hours, Tay started sharing racist and sexist messages after absorbing content from us humans. This shows how AI's growth is contingent on our own progress. On the other hand, since 2016, we have made tremendous progress as a species via content creation focused on gender equality, racial equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and more, all without AI. If we all stopped creating content and solely rely on AI, we will cease to progress as AI continues to recycle our existing content.</p>
            <p>Here are some groundbreaking art and literature that would not have been possible if AI had replaced human content prior to the creation of each masterpiece:</p>

            <p>It is predicted that 90% of content will be generated by AI by 2025 (<a class="text-decoration-underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgYCcdwGwrE" target="_blank">via</a>) and we are certainly heading in that direction. The human touch of originality in all content will become a rare and valuable selling point. AI may seem like it is capable of composing “original content”, the content AI creates is actually based on past human-created content as AI is trained on it. The originality of a human is irreplaceable.</p>

            <h2><img class="me-3" src="/img/advance.svg" alt="">Advance humanity</h2>
            <p>AI is trained using human-created content from the past and can only generate content by recycling and recomposing existing content. If we, as a species, stopped creating content and solely relied on AI, the content AI produced would become repetitive and stagnant. Furthermore, humans are advancing everyday and this reflects on our shifting values on racism, sexism, equality, and more. For AI to be able to generate content with these up-to-date values, humans need to continue to produce new content.</p>

            <p>Your clients, prospects, users will appreciate AI but they will still want humans to address their specific needs. AI may be powerful, it is still only passively listening to prompts to generate answers. Only a trained human can understand the complexity of a real life problem and tailor a solution uniquely for it.</p>
