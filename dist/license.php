            <p class="fw-bold pt-2 mb-2">1. Definitions</p>
            
            <p>"Badge" means any badge, logo, or other mark provided by Not By AI that may be used to indicate that content is not created by AI.</p>
            
            <p>"Content" means any text, audio, video, or other creative work.</p>
            
            <p>"Licensee" means any person or entity that downloads or uses a Badge.</p>
            
            <p class="fw-bold pt-2 mb-2">2. Grant of License</p>
            
            <p>Not By AI grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to use the Badge in connection with Licensee's Content, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
            
            <p class="fw-bold pt-2 mb-2">3. Not By AI 90% Rule</p>
            
            <p>To be eligible to use a Badge, Licensee must comply with the Not By AI 90% Rule, which states that at least 90% of the Content must be created by humans. The Not By AI 90% Rule does not apply to the use of AI for inspiration purposes, supporting legal documents, non-user facing content, looking for grammatical errors and typos, or translating content. Not By AI reserves the right to determine the origin of content in cases of ambiguity regarding whether it is human-created or AI-created. Content created by humans utilizing AI does not qualify as human-created content within the parameters of the Not By AI 90% Rule.</p>
            
            <p class="fw-bold pt-2 mb-2">4. Commercial Use</p>
            
            <p>Licensee may use a Badge for commercial purposes. Not By AI reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, require Licensee to submit Licensee’s Content for verification of compliance with the Not By AI 90% Rule. The verification method and criteria are confidential and proprietary to Not By AI and will not be disclosed to Licensee. By using a Badge, Licensee agrees to cooperate with Not By AI in the verification process and to accept Not By AI’s determination as final and binding. If Licensee refuses or fails to submit Licensee’s Content for verification, or if Licensee’s Content does not pass the verification process, Licensee must cease using the Badge and destroy all copies of the Badge in its possession or control within thirty (30) days after receiving a written notice from Not By AI. Effective May 30, 2023, Licensee must pay a one-time fee of $99 to use the Badge for commercial purposes. The fee is non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the verification process.</p>
            
            <p class="fw-bold pt-2 mb-2">5. Liability</p>
            
            <p>Not By AI provides the Badge “as is” and without any warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or accuracy. Not By AI does not warrant that the Badge will meet Licensee’s requirements or expectations, or that the use of the Badge will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. Licensee assumes all risks and responsibilities associated with the use of the Badge.</p>
            <p>Not By AI shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the use or misuse of the Badge by Licensee or any third parties, even if Not By AI has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Not By AI’s total liability to Licensee under this Agreement exceed the amount paid by Licensee for the use of the Badge.
