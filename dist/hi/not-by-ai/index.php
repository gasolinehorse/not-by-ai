$project_about = 'As the forerunner of the Not By AI movement, we believe in human input. As a result, we are committed to refraining from using AI for content creation. We work in an agile environment and constantly push new ideas live and refine our content creation process and approach. Copy is often typed into Notes on an iPhone, jotted down on paper as bullet lists, or entered directly to the website. The translation of the badges is assisted by humans from all over the world. All graphics and design work are created using Figma, Sketch, and Photoshop (without the AI generative fill feature) by our designer. Just like our web content, all of our social media posts are handcrafted by humans for humans. While we found AI helpful for miscellaneous tasks such as copy-proofing, it lacks the ability to come up with innovative ideas. To execute Not By AI, being innovative is crucial. <br><br>While producing a large amount of content without the help of AI is challenging, we remain committed to our human-centric approach as producing content by humans is a nonnegotiable core value of ours.';
