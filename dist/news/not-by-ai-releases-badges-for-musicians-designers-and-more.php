            <p>[PHILADELPHIA, UNITED STATES, September 30, 2024] â€” Not By AI, a leading advocate for human-created content, has announced the launch of numerous new badges designed for musicians, designers, photographers, animators, filmmakers, voice actors, researchers, sculptors, and more. Not By AI has been serving the industry with its three original Writer, Artist, and Producer badges. Today, Not By AI aim to build on the success of these popular badges to support more creators who value human creativity over AI-generated content. </p>
            <p>The new badges are tailored for content types that extend beyond the scope of the original badges. For example, a graphic designer can now use the Designer badge to show their commitment to human authenticity more accurately. "These new badges were developed through ongoing conversations with our users and creators to understand their needs and learn how Not By AI can improve to support them," said Allen Hsu, founder of Not By AI. </p>
